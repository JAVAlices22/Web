This is a Chess game develped by Marcel Soares Ribeiro and João Vitor Marques as a project for the discipline
CES-22: Programação Orientada a Objetos (Object Oriented Programming), offered at ITA in the first semester of 2015.
One of the requirements of this project was that it comprised some element of web design, hence the name. Ours meets
this requirement by beeing playable over the Internet.
